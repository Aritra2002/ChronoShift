**ChronoShift** is a high-octane, neon-drenched Tower Defense experience set in a crumbling digital frontier. As the last line of defense for the core sectors, you must deploy advanced weaponry to halt the advance of an encroaching robotic swarm.

## 🎮 The Mission

In a world of shifting timelines and digital decay, your objective is simple but absolute: **Hold the Line.**

Navigate through various sectors, from the neon-lit alleys of **Sector Alpha** to the deep-core processing hubs of **Sector Gamma**. Each wave brings faster, tougher, and more intelligent threats.

### 🛠️ Strategic Arsenal
Deploy a variety of high-tech defensive units, each with unique tactical advantages:

*   **📡 Railgun (Archer):** High-velocity kinetic strikes for consistent suppression.
*   **💣 Howitzer (Cannon):** Heavy explosive payloads for area-of-effect devastation.
*   **❄️ Cryo Cell (Frost):** Sub-zero pulses that freeze enemies in their tracks.
*   **⚡ Ion Coil (Tesla):** Arcing electrical discharges that chain through multiple targets.
*   **🎯 Ghost Rail (Sniper):** Long-range, precision critical strikes.
*   **⚛️ Titan Core (Omega):** The ultimate deterrent. Massive splash damage for total eradication.

### ☄️ Emergency Protocols
When the swarm becomes a flood, activate the **Meteor Strike**—a devastating orbital bombardment that deals massive damage to all hostiles on the grid.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Procedural Aesthetics:** Beautiful, algorithmically generated background elements ensure no two battlefields feel exactly the same.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** An exponential scaling system that challenges your strategic depth as the waves progress.
*   **Glass-Morphism UI:** A sleek, modern HUD built with React and Material UI, designed for maximum immersion.
*   **Sector Progression:** Experience different pathing layouts and difficulty multipliers across Alpha, Beta, and Gamma sectors.
*   **Tactical Repairs:** Manually repair your Titan Fortress during the heat of battle to stave off system failure.

## 🚀 Technical Blueprint

ChronoShift is built using a modern web stack optimized for performance and visual fidelity:

*   **Engine:** Custom-built Vanilla JS Game Engine utilizing HTML5 Canvas API.
*   **Frontend:** React 18 for state-driven UI management.
*   **Styling:** Material UI (MUI) for that polished, industrial "Cyber" look.
*   **Graphics:** Procedural Poisson-disk sampling for background decoration and custom particle systems for combat feedback.
